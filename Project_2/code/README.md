# Code

>main.py

The "main" part of the program. Contains a function main() that executes the script on run. main() takes a set of variables that decide which type of training and sampling to use, among other things.

>NN.py

The optional Neural Network part of the project. Not integrated into main.py as I wasn't happy with the implementation, but still left there as it technically works

>RBM.py

The backend of the project. Contains the RBM class and everything relating to the RBM model itself.
